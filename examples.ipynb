      "### 1. Increase Your Education Level\n",
      "The most consistent factor among the positive outcomes is a higher level of education. All of the counterfactual cases that predicted an income of more than $50k involved individuals with higher education levels than your current \"HS-grad\" status. Specifically, obtaining a:\n",

      "\n",
      "- **Professional**\n",
      "- **White-Collar**\n",
      "\n",
      "If possible, seek opportunities that allow you to transition into these types of roles.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Explore Opportunities in Different Workclasses\n",
      "Although less common in the counterfactuals, changing your workclass from \"Private\" to \"Government\" may also help you achieve a higher income. This could involve looking for job opportunities within governmental organizations.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Gender Consideration\n",
      "One of the counterfactuals showed that gender might play a role, with the same education and occupation, a male was predicted to earn more than $50k while a female was not. While it's not actionable to change your gender, being aware of potential gender biases can help you advocate for fair pay and seek organizations that prioritize equity.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary\n",
      "To maximize your chances of earning more than $50k a year:\n",
      "1. **Pursue higher education** - Aim for at least a Bachelor's degree or higher.\n",
      "2. **Change your occupation** - Look for opportunities to move into professional or white-collar roles.\n",
      "3. **Consider workclass changes** - Explore job opportunities in the government sector.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Rules:\n",
      "1. **Higher education levels lead to higher income**: The transition from \"Some-college\" to \"Doctorate\" in the counterfactual cases is associated with a higher income.\n",
      "   - Example: Case 1, 2, and 3 show individuals with \"Doctorate\" education achieving higher income.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Race diversity in certain cases**: The counterfactual outcome shows that individuals with the race \"Other\" can achieve higher income.\n",
      "   - Example: Case 0 and 4 show individuals of race \"Other\" achieving higher income.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Increased working hours can lead to higher income**: The counterfactual outcome shows that working more hours per week (e.g., 53 hours) is associated with higher income.\n",
      "   - Example: Case 0 shows an individual working 53 hours per week achieving a higher income.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Government workclass can lead to higher income**: The counterfactual outcome shows that individuals working in the \"Government\" sector have higher income.\n",
      "   - Example: Case 1 shows an individual working in the \"Government\" sector achieving higher income.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary:\n",
      "- **Education**: Advanced degrees such as \"Doctorate\" are linked with higher income.\n",
      "- **Race**: Individuals of race \"Other\" can achieve higher income in certain scenarios.\n",
      "- **Hours per Week**: More working hours per week (e.g., 53 hours) are associated with higher income.\n",
      "- **Workclass**: Employment in the \"Government\" sector is linked with higher income.\n",
      "\n",
      "These rules indicate that improving education levels, considering racial diversity, increasing work hours, and employment in certain work sectors can potentially lead to a higher income.\n",
      "Results:\n",
      "Number of counterfactuals following Rule 1 (Higher education levels lead to higher income): 3\n",
      "Number of counterfactuals following Rule 2 (Race diversity in certain cases): 2\n",
      "Number of counterfactuals following Rule 3 (Increased working hours can lead to higher income): 1\n",
      "Number of counterfactuals following Rule 4 (Government workclass can lead to higher income): 1\n",
      "\n",
      "Explanation:\n",
      "Based on the analysis of the factors influencing income, here are actionable steps you can take to improve your chances of earning more than $50,000 a year:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Pursue Higher Education**: The analysis indicates that higher education levels, such as obtaining a Doctorate, are strongly associated with higher income. Investing in furthering your education can significantly enhance your earning potential. Consider enrolling in advanced degree programs or professional courses that can bolster your qualifications and open up higher-paying opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Consider Racial Diversity as a Factor**: While not a direct action you can take, it's important to recognize that individuals of different racial backgrounds can achieve higher incomes in certain scenarios. This insight stresses the importance of creating and supporting diverse and inclusive workplaces that value contributions from all racial backgrounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Increase Your Working Hours**: The data shows that working more hours per week, specifically around 53 hours, is linked to higher income. If feasible, increasing your weekly working hours could contribute to higher earnings. However, ensure that this increase is sustainable and does not negatively impact your work-life balance or health.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Explore Employment in the Government Sector**: Employment in the Government sector is associated with higher income. If you're considering a career change, exploring job opportunities within the Government sector could be beneficial. Government jobs often come with additional benefits and stability that can positively impact your financial situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Education**: Aim to obtain higher education degrees like a Doctorate to significantly boost your income potential.\n",
      "- **Race**: Promote and support workplace diversity to ensure opportunities are available to all, regardless of race.\n",
      "- **Work Hours**: Consider increasing your working hours to around 53 hours per week to potentially raise your income.\n",
      "- **Work Sector**: Look into job opportunities within the Government sector, which may offer higher wages and additional benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "By making strategic decisions about your education, work hours, and employment sector, you can improve your chances of moving to a higher income class. Each of these steps plays a role in enhancing your economic standing and achieving your financial goals.\n",

      "Rules:\n",
      "From the given data, we can derive a set of rules based on the differences between the negative assessment outcome and the positive counterfactual outcomes. Here are the most important observed rules:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Education Level**: \n",
      "   - Moving from \"Some-college\" to \"Masters\" can lead to a positive outcome.\n",
      "   - Staying with \"Some-college\" but changing other factors (like occupation or race) can also lead to a positive outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Occupation**:\n",
      "   - Changing from \"Other/Unknown\" to \"White-Collar\" or \"Professional\" can lead to a positive outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Race**:\n",
      "   - Changing the race from \"White\" to \"Other\" can lead to a positive outcome, as seen in multiple counterfactual cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Hours per Week**:\n",
      "   - Increasing the number of hours worked per week from 40 to 74 can lead to a positive outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is the detailed list of rules inferred from the data:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Rules for Positive Outcome\n",
      "1. **Rule 1**:\n",
      "   - **Condition**: Education = \"Masters\"\n",
      "   - **Outcome**: Positive (income > 50k)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Rule 2**:\n",
      "   - **Condition**: Occupation = \"White-Collar\"\n",
      "   - **Outcome**: Positive (income > 50k)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Rule 3**:\n",
      "   - **Condition**: Occupation = \"Professional\"\n",
      "   - **Outcome**: Positive (income > 50k)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Rule 4**:\n",
      "   - **Condition**: Race = \"Other\"\n",
      "   - **Outcome**: Positive (income > 50k)\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Rule 5**:\n",
      "   - **Condition**: Hours per Week > 40 (e.g., 74)\n",
      "   - **Outcome**: Positive (income > 50k)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Combination Rules\n",
      "1. **Combination Rule 1**:\n",
      "   - **Condition**: Education = \"Some-college\" AND Occupation = \"Other/Unknown\" AND Race = \"Other\"\n",
      "   - **Outcome**: Positive (income > 50k)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Combination Rule 2**:\n",
      "   - **Condition**: Education = \"Some-college\" AND Occupation = \"Professional\"\n",
      "   - **Outcome**: Positive (income > 50k)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary of Observations:\n",
      "- Having a higher level of education (like a Master's degree) can significantly improve the chances of earning more than 50k.\n",
      "- Working in a more specialized or white-collar occupation rather than an unknown or unclassified occupation can lead to a positive outcome.\n",
      "- The race factor seems to interact with other variables like occupation and education, and changing it to \"Other\" can sometimes lead to a positive outcome.\n",
      "- Working more hours per week (e.g., 74 hours) can also lead to a positive outcome, even if the occupation or education level does not change.\n",

      "- **Occupation**: Moving into specialized or white-collar jobs is crucial.\n",
      "- **Work Hours**: Increasing work hours can positively impact your income.\n",
      "- **Race**: While this factor interacts with other variables, it's not actionable.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Call to Action:\n",
      "To improve your chances of earning more than $50,000 a year, focus on the following:\n",
      "1. **Pursue higher education**, specifically a Master's degree if possible.\n",
      "2. **Seek opportunities to move into White-Collar or Professional occupations**.\n",
      "3. **Consider increasing your work hours** if it is sustainable and practical for you.\n",

      "Based on the provided negative assessment outcome and the positive counterfactual outcomes, we can derive the following rules that may lead to a higher income (greater than $50K a year):\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Higher Education**:\n",
      "   - Individuals with a higher level of education, such as a Doctorate or Prof-school, tend to have higher incomes.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Workclass**:\n",
      "   - Employment in the Government sector can lead to higher income compared to \"Other/Unknown\" work classes.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Age**:\n",
      "   - Although not directly a rule from the data provided, it's worth noting that an age of 79 was observed with a higher income. This might suggest that individuals who remain in the workforce until an older age could potentially accumulate more wealth, but this is less likely to be a strong rule without more context.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Hours per Week**:\n",
      "   - Working significantly more hours per week can lead to a higher income, as seen in the case where a person worked 69 hours per week and had a higher income.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Race**:\n",
      "   - While not explicitly clear from the given data, there is a positive outcome for an individual identified as \"Other\" race. This could be indicative but is not a strong rule without more evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are the derived rules:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Higher education (Doctorate, Prof-school) leads to higher income.**\n",
      "2. **Employment in the Government sector can lead to higher income.**\n",
      "3. **Working significantly more hours per week (e.g., 69 hours) can lead to higher income.**\n",
      "\n",
      "These rules are inferred based on the observations from the given data and should be validated with a larger dataset for more accurate conclusions.\n",

      "   - **Action:** Invest in furthering your education. Consider enrolling in advanced degree programs or professional courses. This can significantly enhance your qualifications and open up higher-paying opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Seek Employment in Specialized or Government Sectors:**\n",

      "   - **Action:** If feasible, try to increase your working hours. However, be mindful of maintaining a healthy work-life balance and ensure this increase is sustainable for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Consider Racial Diversity Factors:**\n",
      "   - **Why?** While race itself is not something you can change, the data suggested that individuals from diverse racial backgrounds sometimes achieved higher incomes in certain contexts.\n",
      "   - **Action:** This insight highlights the importance of supporting diverse and inclusive workplaces. Ensure that your workplace values contributions from all backgrounds, as this can create a more equitable environment for everyone.\n",
